# Apple Website Clone

This project is a responsive clone of the official Apple website, developed with modern frontend technologies to deliver a polished and interactive user experience.

## Overview

This clone aims to replicate the user experience and design of Apple’s website with a clean, minimalistic UI. The project structure and code were inspired by [Adrian Hajdin's iPhone Project](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/iphone/tree/main), which served as a valuable resource for understanding responsive layout design and animations. All code in this repository was rewritten and implemented by me, using Adrian’s project as a foundation.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Smooth Animations**: Includes hover and scrolling animations to enhance the user experience.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Organized and reusable components to make future updates and maintenance easy.
- **Interactive UI**: Functional navigation and interactive elements that mimic the feel of the official Apple website.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** and **CSS3**: For basic structure and styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For functionality and animations.
- **React**: Component-based structure for a scalable and maintainable codebase.
- **Responsive Design**: Flexbox and CSS Grid were heavily used to create a fluid layout.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
